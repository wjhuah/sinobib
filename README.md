        <h2>🌍 Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This bibliography aims to be inclusive from the Neolithic through the pre-Buddhist era and contains more than 15,750 entries.  
            <span class="highlight">(</span>The definition of “pre-Buddhist” is inevitably fuzzy<span class="highlight">)</span>.  
            Earlier Stone Age cultures, as well as Neolithic cultures from regions beyond the Yellow and Yangzi River Valleys and areas, such as prehistoric Taiwan, are not comprehensively covered.  
            Please do not hesitate to inform the compiler of errors or omissions, which are inevitable in a project of this scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sake of concision, anthologies of papers by a single author are listed once, under title of the volume.  
            <span class="highlight">(</span>The original bibliographical information of any articles revised or reprinted in such anthologies is omitted, as are the original details of articles that were later expanded into or incorporated within a book by the same author<span class="highlight">)</span>.  
            Book reviews, articles in encyclopedias and newsletters, exhibition catalogues, and unscholarly works are not normally included.  
            The original publication date of a work that was subsequently translated or re-issued sometimes appears at the end of a citation in brackets <span class="highlight">[1995]</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Other notes:</strong> Capitalization and italicization are standardized silently, and I do not capitalize Chinese terms that are not proper names <span class="highlight">(</span>such as <em>qi 氣</em><span class="highlight">)</span>.  
            Romanized Chinese names are alphabetized by syllable <span class="highlight">(</span>for example, <em>Qizhi</em> comes before <em>Qiong</em><span class="highlight">)</span>.  
            Surnames containing “von,” “van,” “de,” etc. are alphabetized according to the author’s preference <span class="highlight">(</span>to the best of my knowledge<span class="highlight">)</span>.  
            Birth and death years are provided for authors born before 1900, whenever I can ascertain them.

        <p>
            Huge thanks to all students and colleagues who have helped over the years! 🎓✨  
            I am aware that many relevant titles in Russian are missing—one day this may be systematically rectified. 🌍
