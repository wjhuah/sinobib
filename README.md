Last Updated: April 5, 2025 (Civilization) | February 7, 2025 (Manuscripts)
Repository: https://github.com/wjhuah/sinobib
🌏 Project Overview
This repository hosts two meticulously curated bibliographies focused on Ancient Chinese Civilization and Ancient Chinese Manuscripts in Western languages. Designed for scholars and researchers, the resources cover materials from the Neolithic era through the pre-Buddhist period (flexible definition) and related manuscript studies.
📖 Key Bibliographies
1. 🏺 Ancient Chinese Civilization Bibliography

Exclusions:
Early Stone Age cultures, Neolithic cultures outside the Yellow/Yangzi River Valleys (e.g., prehistoric Taiwan).
Book reviews, encyclopedia articles, newsletters, exhibition catalogs, and non-scholarly works.
2. 📜 Ancient Chinese Manuscripts Bibliography

📝 Content & Formatting Guidelines
🔍 Scope & Inclusions

Concision:
Single-author anthologies listed once by volume title (no duplicate entries for revised/reprinted articles).
Original publication dates of translated/reissued works noted in brackets (e.g., [1950]).
✨ Format Standards
Capitalization: Chinese non-proper nouns (e.g., qi 氣) are not capitalized; titles follow Western formatting rules.

Romanized Chinese names sorted by syllable (e.g., Qizhi comes before Qiong).
Surnames with prefixes (e.g., "von", "van") follow the author’s preferred order.
Author Details: Birth/death years included for authors born before 1900 (when verifiable, e.g., Liang Qichao (1873–1929)).
